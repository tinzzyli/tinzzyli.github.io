        - Design two adversarial attack approaches for an object grasping benchmark, respectively adding an opponent agent and feeding an attacked image as input.
        - Implement a differentiable rendering method to replace the original renderer of BulletArm. Use the gradient from the differentiable renderer to produce adversarial inputs.

      description: 
        - An analysis of popular financial fraud detection algorithms and put forward suggestions for improvement.
        - Comparison of unsupervised outlier scores computed at different levels of granularity is performed and tested on a credit card fraud detection dataset. Use deep learning models such as STAN, DAE, and CNN. It is found that the current financial fraud detection models are dependent on the dataset, have high computational expenses, and are usually overfitted. The solution can be to improve the diversity of datasets and reduce the time and memory costs.
        - The research result is published as Deep Learning Techniques for Financial Fraud Detection.
