### 1 Introduction

It took me three years to discover what I truly excelled at and loved. While the process was undoubtedly challenging, it was never painful. Before taking a firm step into artificial intelligence, I have spent countless late nights pondering and seeking a balance between computer science and chemistry. Beginning with online courses, I gradually equipped myself with the necessary knowledge and skills for further research. I soon began reaching out to labs and secured a research assistant position.

As someone who does not majoring in computer science, I put in extra effort to reach the same level as those who have specialized in this field. But all the toughness I exprienced are not hateful. Instead, they made up an important part of me, leaving me with an unwavering belief that every step I took would lay a solid foundation for my doctoral research, both in terms of knowledge structure and mental construction.

Standing at the intersection of learning and robustness study. I believe machine learning research of our times has come to a turning point, I want to investigate the learning and decision pattern of machine learning models in order to build robust machine learning models that are trustworthy under any kinds of adversarial inputs. Bringing the power of artificial intelligence to human beings in a reliable and harmless way.

### 2 Motivation

During my undergraduate studies at University of Leicester, I initially pursued a major in chemistry. However, a chance encounter with a math modeling contest opened up a new world of oppor- tunities and ignited a passion for computer science. Specifically, I became fascinated with neural networks and time-sequence analysis.

Motivated by my newfound interest, I delved deeper into the field of artificial intelligence. Seek- ing to apply my knowledge in a practical setting, I participated in a survey project on credit card fraud detection. As a part of the project, we analyzed popular financial fraud detection algorithms and proposed ideas for their improvement. Additionally, we tried to reproduce the results on vari- ous datasets. We revealed that current financial fraud detection models are often dataset-dependent, computationally expensive, and susceptible to overfitting.

As I became increasingly devoted to computer science and machine learning, I found it increas- ingly challenging to excel in both chemistry and computer science simultaneously. This led to a dip in my grades, which was a significant setback. Nevertheless, it was a valuable learning experience that made me realize the importance of focusing on my priorities.

### 3 Research Experience

During my undergraduate studies, I struggled to decide between studying computer science and chemistry. To gain more clarity, I took a gap year and traveled to Munich, Germany as part of an exchange program with Technical University of Munich. During this time, I explored both subjects by taking courses and realized that I enjoyed coding more than conducting chemistry experiments.

Upon returning to my home institution, I made the decision to pursue computer science and reached out to professors for intern positions. After submitting numerous applications, I was de- lighted to conduct research under the guidance of Professor Jiao. My project focused on evaluating the robustness of Vision Transformers (ViT) by analyzing their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Through my research, I found that ViT models were more susceptible to adversarial attacks compared to CNN and discovered that the model’s attention was drawn to the perturbed patch. To address this vulnerability, I proposed the use of negative data augmentation and modifications to the loss function.

My passion for robust machine learning led me to join the Intelligent Robotics and Vision Lab (IRVL) at University of Texas, Dallas, co-advised by Professors Yang and Xiang. Here, I am conducted research on producing adversarial examples for a robotic arm in object grasping. To attack both the Deep Q-Learning Network and the camera rendering process, I managed to concatenate the physics engine and a differentiable renderer, which allows perfect image reproduction. I also produced and evaluated two types of adversarial examples. One of them is changing the object’s location, which is very likely to happen in real world, to make the robotic arm fail or takes more than one attempt to grasp. The other is applying a tiny deformation on the object to investigate whether a deformed object is more difficult to grasp. Our project welldemonstrating my understanding of the model’s decision boundaries and features extracted by neural networks and of significant importance to industry.

### 4 Future Plans

My research interests revolve around developing machine learning models that are reliable, trust- worthy, and robust to adversarial attacks. The recent advancements in machine learning have led to significant improvements in various fields, but the potential risks and uncertainties associated with the use of these models have also become more apparent. I am intrigued by the complex task of cre- ating trustworthy AI models that can safely enhance our lives with ethical and intelligent solutions. I believe that the key to unlocking the full potential of AI lies in my further research.

For my doctoral research, I plan to investigate the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the robustness of machine learning models. I aim to develop novel algorithms and techniques that can improve the robustness and reliability of existing models. Additionally, I plan to study the impact of various kind of adversarial attacks on machine learning models, and develop mitigation techniques to make models more resilient to such attacks. This research will contribute to the development of more trustworthy and reliable machine learning models that can be deployed in real-world applications, such as autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, and financial forecasting. Ultimately, I hope to make significant contributions to the field of machine learning and help ensure that these models are used ethically and responsibly for the betterment of society.
