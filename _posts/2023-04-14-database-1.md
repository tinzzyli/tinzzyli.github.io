# Introduction to Database Techniques

In the world of database management, there are several key concepts that are critical to understand in order to create efficient and effective database systems.

## Primary Key

A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a database table. It is used to ensure that each record can be uniquely identified and accessed. There are several types of primary keys usage in a database system:

**NULL**

- A primary key that allows ***NULL values*** can create issues with data consistency and referential integrity. It is generally recommended to avoid using NULL as a primary key.

**Composite Primary Key**

- A ***composite primary key*** is a primary key that is made up of two or more columns. This can be useful when a single column cannot uniquely identify a record, but a combination of columns can.
Multiple Primary Key

```sql
CREATE TABLE my_table (
  id INT NOT NULL,
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id, date)
);
```

**Muliple primary keys**

- ***Multiple primary keys*** are not supported in MySQL. It is generally recommended to use a composite primary key instead.

**How to choose**

- When selecting a primary key, it is important to choose a key that is ***unique*** and ***stable***. It should also be a value that will not change over time, as this can create issues with referential integrity.

## Identity Column

An identity column is a column in a database table that is automatically generated by the database management system. This can be useful for creating unique identifiers for records in a table.

**Auto-increment and Sequence**

- Auto-increment is a feature in MySQL that automatically generates a unique number for a column in a table. Sequences are similar, but they are typically used in other database management systems.

- For example, suppose we want to create a table named orders with an id column that auto-increments starting from 100 with a step of 10:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INT,
  order_date DATE,
  amount DECIMAL(10,2)
) AUTO_INCREMENT=100, 
INCREMENT=10;
```

- Now, whenever we insert a new row into the orders table without specifying a value for the id column, MySQL will automatically assign a unique value starting from 100 with a step of 10:

```sql
INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, order_date, amount)
VALUES (1, '2022-04-01', 100.00);

-- id column will be 100

INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, order_date, amount)
VALUES (2, '2022-04-02', 200.00);

-- id column will be 110

INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, order_date, amount)
VALUES (3, '2022-04-03', 300.00);

-- id column will be 120
```

**Relationship between Primary Keys and Foreign Keys**

- Primary keys and foreign keys are used to establish relationships between tables in a database system. A foreign key is a field in a table that is linked to the primary key of another table. This helps to ensure that data remains consistent and accurate throughout the database.

-To create a table with a foreign key:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INT,
  order_date DATE,
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers (customer_id)
);
```

- To create a table with a composite foreign key:

```sql
CREATE TABLE order_details (
  order_id INT,
  product_id INT,
  quantity INT,
  PRIMARY KEY (order_id, product_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders (order_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products (product_id)
);
```

# SQL Syntax

MySQL syntax is the set of commands and rules used to interact with a MySQL database. It includes various types of queries, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, which allow you to manipulate data stored in tables. In addition, MySQL syntax also includes commands for creating tables, altering table structures, and defining relationships between tables. By understanding MySQL syntax, you can perform a wide range of operations on a MySQL database, including inserting and updating data, querying data, and managing table structures.

## Virtual Tables: JOIN and WITH

Virtual tables are temporary tables that can be created in memory during a SQL query. JOIN is a SQL keyword that is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. WITH is a keyword used to define a temporary table that can be referenced multiple times within a SQL query.

- To join two tables using the JOIN syntax:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table1
JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

- To join two tables using the WITH syntax:

```sql
WITH table1 AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM my_table
), table2 AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM other_table
)
SELECT *
FROM table1
JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

## Grouping and Aggregation

***Grouping and aggregation*** are SQL functions that allow for the summarization of data within a table. GROUP BY is a SQL keyword that is used to group rows together based on a common column. Aggregation functions, such as SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, and COUNT, are used to calculate values within these groups. This can be useful for creating summary reports and analyzing data.

- Grouping Queries and Grouping Aggregates

In SQL, grouping queries are used to group rows that have the same values in one or more columns. This is often used in conjunction with aggregate functions, which perform calculations on a group of rows rather than on individual rows.

The syntax for a grouping query is as follows:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ..., aggregate_function(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column1, column2, ...;
```

Here, column1, column2, etc. are the columns you want to group by, and aggregate_function is the function you want to apply to the grouped rows. For example, you might use the SUM function to calculate the total sales for each product category:

```sql
SELECT category, SUM(sales)
FROM sales_table
GROUP BY category;
```

This would return a result set with one row for each unique value in the category column, and the total sales for that category.

You can also use the HAVING clause to filter the results of a grouping query based on the results of an aggregate function. For example, to only return categories with total sales greater than 100, you could modify the above query as follows:

```sql
SELECT category, SUM(sales)
FROM sales_table
GROUP BY category
HAVING SUM(sales) > 100;
```

This would only return rows where the sum of sales for that category is greater than 100.

Grouping queries can also be used to perform calculations on groups of rows. For example, to calculate the average sales for each category, you could use the AVG function:

```sql
SELECT category, AVG(sales)
FROM sales_table
GROUP BY category;
```

This would return the average sales for each category in the sales_table.
