# Database Design

## Entity-Relationship (E-R) Diagram

An E-R (Entity-Relationship) diagram is a graphical representation of the relationships between entities in a database. It consists of entities (objects or concepts), attributes (properties or characteristics of entities), and relationships (associations between entities).

Here's an example of an E-R diagram, using a fictional bookstore database:

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/ER1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

Entities:

- Book: This entity represents the books in the library and has attributes such as book ID, title, author, publisher, and ISBN.
- Member: This entity represents the members of the library and has attributes such as member ID, name, address, and phone number.
- Staff: This entity represents the staff of the library and has attributes such as staff ID, name, and job title.
- Department: This entity represents the departments within the library and has attributes such as department ID and name.

Relationships:

- Borrows: This relationship connects the Member and Book entities and indicates that a member can borrow multiple books and a book can be borrowed by multiple members. The relationship has attributes such as borrow ID, borrow date, and due date.
- Issues: This relationship connects the Staff and Book entities and indicates that a staff member can issue a book to a member. The relationship has attributes such as issue ID, issue date, and return date.
- Manages: This relationship connects the Staff and Department entities and indicates that a staff member can manage multiple departments and a department can be managed by multiple staff members. The relationship has attributes such as manage ID and manage date.

Here's a table summarizing the entities, their attributes, and their relationships:

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/ER2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

Overall, this E-R diagram illustrates how the different entities in a library management system are related to each other and how they can be used to keep track of book loans, staff responsibilities, and other important information.

## Three Normal Forms in Database Designing

Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to eliminate redundancy and dependency. The goal is to minimize data redundancy and make the database more efficient, maintainable, and flexible.

There are several normal forms in database design, but the three most commonly used are:

- **First Normal Form (1NF)**: This requires that every attribute in a table is atomic, which means that it cannot be divided into smaller pieces. Each row in the table must be unique and identified by a primary key.

- **Second Normal Form (2NF)**: This requires that the table is in 1NF and that all non-key attributes in the table are dependent on the entire primary key. If any non-key attribute is dependent on only part of the primary key, it should be moved to a separate table.

- **Third Normal Form (3NF)**: This requires that the table is in 2NF and that all non-key attributes in the table are not dependent on other non-key attributes. If any non-key attribute is dependent on another non-key attribute, it should be moved to a separate table.

Here's a table that illustrates the different normal forms using an example of a student database:

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/ER3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

This table is not in 1NF because the "Name" attribute is not atomic. It can be divided into "First Name" and "Last Name." Here's the table in 1NF:

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/ER4.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

This table is now in 1NF because each attribute is atomic and the table has a primary key (Student ID).

To make this table 2NF, we need to identify a composite primary key that includes more than one attribute. In this case, we could use both "Student ID" and "Major" as the composite primary key, because each student can have more than one major. Here's the table in 2NF:

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/ER5.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

Finally, to make this table 3NF, we need to ensure that all non-key attributes are dependent on the entire composite primary key. In this case, "Address" and "Phone Number" are dependent only on "Student ID," not on "Major." So we need to move them to a separate table. Here's how the tables would look like:

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/ER6.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
