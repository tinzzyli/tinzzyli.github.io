# Subquery

In MySQL, subqueries can be used in conjunction with `WHERE`, `IN`, `NOT IN`, `EXISTS`, and `NOT EXISTS` to achieve more complex query logic. Let me explain the applications of these subqueries with examples:

1. Using a subquery with the `WHERE` clause:
   A subquery can be used as part of the `WHERE` clause to restrict the conditions for the returned results.

   Example: Retrieve customers with a total order amount greater than the average order amount.

   ```sql
   SELECT customer_name
   FROM orders
   WHERE total_amount > (SELECT AVG(total_amount) FROM orders);
   ```

2. Using a subquery with the `IN` operator:
   The `IN` subquery is used to check if a column's value exists in the result set returned by a subquery.

   Example: Retrieve customers who have purchased a specific product.

   ```sql
   SELECT customer_name
   FROM customers
   WHERE customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM orders WHERE product_id = '123');
   ```

3. Using a subquery with the `NOT IN` operator:
   The `NOT IN` subquery is used to check if a column's value does not exist in the result set returned by a subquery.

   Example: Retrieve customers who have not made any purchases.

   ```sql
   SELECT customer_name
   FROM customers
   WHERE customer_id NOT IN (SELECT customer_id FROM orders);
   ```

4. Using a subquery with the `EXISTS` operator:
   The `EXISTS` subquery is used to check if the result set returned by a subquery exists.

   Example: Retrieve customers who have at least one order record.

   ```sql
   SELECT customer_name
   FROM customers c
   WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM orders o WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id);
   ```

5. Using a subquery with the `NOT EXISTS` operator:
   The `NOT EXISTS` subquery is used to check if the result set returned by a subquery does not exist.

   Example: Retrieve customers who have no order records.

   ```sql
   SELECT customer_name
   FROM customers c
   WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM orders o WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id);
   ```

Please note that when using these subqueries, ensure that the result sets returned by the subqueries are accurate and make adjustments based on the database structure and query requirements.
