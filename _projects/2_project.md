AI for science has evolved from training a deep neural network(DNN) to leveraging LLMs. Former works like <a href="https://github.com/MolecularAI/Chemformer">ChemFormer</a> achieved great success in accuracy, however, it's trained for specific tasks. A more recent work, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18365.pdf"><em>What LLMs can do in Chemistry?</em></a>, shows that LLMs' potential in solving chemistry tasks.
